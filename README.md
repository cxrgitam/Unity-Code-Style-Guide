# An example of a Unity C# code style guide

### It is absolutely necessary to follow these conventions in the projects of CXR.

## Why should you consider a code style guide?
This code style guide provides a clear set of rules or guidelines that each developer in CXR should adhere to when writing code.
While there is no one correct way to format your Unity C# code, agreeing on a consistent style across the team can help you develop a clean, readable, and scalable codebase. A code style guide helps you remove the guesswork for every member of your team by establishing consensus around important coding conventions, thereby supporting the growth of your codebase into a commercial-scale production.
